# Cursor UI Clone

Live Demo: https://ramankurai.github.io/Cursor-ui-clone/  
Source Code: https://github.com/RamanKurai/Cursor-ui-clone

A handcrafted clone of the **Cursor.dev landing page** built using only **HTML and CSS** — no JS, no libraries, no frameworks.

## 🧱 What’s Recreated

This clone faithfully rebuilds the core visual and structural sections of the original landing page:

- **Header & Navigation**  
  Logo + nav links + hero call-to-action
- **Hero Section**  
  Headline, subheadline, key buttons, and hero imagery
- **Features / Info Sections**  
  Static blocks showcasing major product benefits
- **Secondary CTA Section**  
  Bold call to action style elements
- **Footer**  
  Simple footer with links and copyright

Everything you see is handcrafted using semantic HTML and pure CSS.
